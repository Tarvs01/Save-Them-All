      "Sunda tigers can be recognized by their strong, black stripes on their orange coats. Less than 400 Sunda island tigers are thought to remain, and they are fighting for survival in the final remaining forest regions on Sumatra. This majestic species, like its Javan and Balinese cousins, may become extinct as a result of the acceleration of deforestation and the prevalence of poaching.\n \n Anybody caught shooting tigers in Indonesia may be subject to heavy fines and incarceration. There is still a sizable market for tiger parts and items in Sumatra and other parts of Asia, despite improved efforts in tiger conservation, such as bolstering law enforcement and antipoaching skills. Sunda tigers are always in danger from poaching as their habitat and prey are being destroyed.",

    about:
      "One of the most well-known and extensively researched butterflies on the planet is the monarch. Its black lines and white dot borders encircle its orange wings. Millions of monarch butterflies make their famous seasonal journey from the United States and Canada to southern California and Mexico for the winter.\n \nWestern monarchs have declined by more than 99 percent since the 1980s.\nEastern monarchs have declined by an estimated 80 percent. \n \nOne of the main causes of their population reduction is the loss of milkweed. The only plant that caterpillars and monarch butterflies will lay their eggs on is milkweed, which used to flourish in and around agricultural crops. The quantity of milkweed available has been drastically decreased in recent years due to systematic removal from fields, increasing use of herbicides, and mowing along highways and ditches.\n \n The effects of climate change are also a problem for many reasons. Because monarchs are extremely sensitive to temperature and weather variations, a changing climate may have an impact on biological processes including when to reproduce and migrate. As a result, their nesting grounds, where milkweed is present, and their capacity to survive directly are all significantly impacted. If the temperature is too hot or cold, monarch butterflies will perish.",

      "The Cape hunting dog or painted dog are two of the many names for the African wild dog. Its scientific name, Lycaon pictus, which refers to the animal's uneven, mottled coat and displays areas of red, black, brown, white, and yellow fur, literally translates to 'painted wolf.' All animals have large, rounded ears, and each has a distinct coat pattern. Unlike ordinary dogs, which have five toes on their front feet, these long-legged pups only have four toes per foot. \n \nThe majority of the continent, where African wild dogs historically lived, including desert and mountain ecosystems, has seen their disappearance. Nowadays, sub-Saharan Africa's broad plains and scant woodlands are where you may usually find African wild dogs. Their biggest numbers are found in Tanzania, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Namibia, and Zambia.  \n \nRegrettably, farmers who are worried about their cattle frequently shoot and kill African wild dogs. Together with their vulnerability to diseases like rabies and canine distemper, they are also threatened by the decreasing amount of room they have to wander in their native Africa. The African wild dog's population level fluctuates but is reportedly in an irreversible decline, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which classifies this species as endangered.",

    about:
      "Although most people picture leopards stalking the African savannas, these spotted predators actually survive in a variety of locations and environments. Mountainous woods in eastern Russia and northern China are home to Amur leopards. These cats, which take their name from the Amur River, a body of water that forms the border between the two nations, have adapted admirably to this challenging setting. Its enormous, snowshoe-like paws enable them to travel on snow without sinking, and their silky, dense fur keeps them warm in the extreme cold.\n \nAround 30 pounds lighter than the typical African leopard, Amur leopards weigh about 80 pounds. Yet, these cats can still kill prey that is three times their size. If they can't find any larger game, they will eat mice and rabbits in addition to the deer and boar they prefer to feast on. As they are so adept at approaching prey covertly, scientists occasionally refer to Amur leopards as 'silent killers.'\n \nAmur leopards are one of the most endangered wild cats on the planet and the rarest leopard in the entire globe due to habitat loss and hunting. Nonetheless, Amur leopards are making a comeback, in part because of a recently created national park along the Chinese and Russian borders. In 2018, there were roughly 80 Amur leopards, up from only about 30 in the early 2000s, thanks to the creation of the 647,400-acre refuge known as Land of the Leopard National Park in 2012. According to officials, the population of the park will continue to rise with the support of efficient law enforcement. So, it is hoped that additional leopard sightings will occur soon.",

      "Hawksbill sea turtles are not exceptionally huge in comparison to other sea turtles, reaching a maximum shell length of 45 inches and a weight of 150 pounds. Its carapace, or upper shell, is heart-shaped while they are young but elongates as they get older. Their brightly colored carapace has overlapping scutes, or thick bone plates, and is serrated. The hawksbill turtle gets its name from the way its tapering head terminates in a sharp tip that resembles a bird's beak. Each flipper has two claws, which is another distinguishing characteristic. In comparison to females, male hawksbills have thicker tails, larger claws, and slightly brighter colors.\n \nThe Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans all contain tropical waters where hawksbill turtles can be found. They stay away from deep seas and choose the coasts where there are lots of the sponges they like to eat and accessible sandy areas for breeding. These migratory reptiles play an important role in preserving the environment of coral reefs. Due to their omnivorous nature, hawksbills will also consume fish, jellyfish, crustaceans, sea urchins, mollusks, and marine algae. Despite the fact that their tough shells shield them from many predators, they are nonetheless preyed upon by huge fish, sharks, crocodiles, octopuses, and humans.\n \nHawksbill sea turtles are critically endangered, like many other sea turtles, largely because of human activity. Since ancient Egypt, people have valued tortoise shells, and hawksbills are no exception with their magnificent shells. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, millions of hawksbills have been killed in the past century for the tortoiseshell trade. Notwithstanding the 1993 cessation of the legal international hawksbill shell trade, commerce still occurs.",

Their trees are felled to make way for farms, fuel, and homes. Yet, a large number of committed researchers, park rangers, and other concerned individuals are making significant efforts to safeguard mountain gorillas, their forests, and their way of life in the mountains.\n \nIn 2008, as their numbers increased, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, which determines the conservation status of species, revised their designation from 'critically endangered' to 'endangered.'

They drink water from holes in trees and eat wild fruits like lychees, mangosteens, and figs. They build nests in the vegetation-covered trees where they spend the night and relax during the day. Orangutans can weigh up to 200 pounds as adults. Males with flanges have large cheek pads known as flanges and a throat sac known as a long caller that is utilized to produce loud vocalizations. Unflanged males have the appearance of mature females. An unflanged male can transform into a flanged male for unknown causes in a biological phenomena that is specific to primates.\n \nOrangutans from Borneo and Sumatra have a few subtle behavioral and physical differences. Sumatran orangutans have longer facial hair while having shaggy reddish fur like their counterparts. There are rumors that Sumatran orangutans and their Bornean relatives have tighter social ties. Bornean orangutans are more likely to move about on the ground by coming down from the trees. Severe population decreases have been seen in both species. There were likely more than 230,000 orangutans in existence a century ago, but the Bornean orangutan's current population is estimated to be around 104,700 (Endangered) based on updated geographic range, and the Sumatran orangutan at about 7,500. (Critically Endangered).\n \nIn November 2017, a third species of orangutan was identified. The Tapanuli orangutan is the most endangered of the great apes, with fewer than 800 individuals remaining.",

      "The only Asian rhinoceros with two horns, Sumatran rhinos are the smallest rhinoceroses still in existence. They have a thick coat of hair and are more similar to extinct woolly rhinos than any other living rhino species. Calves are born with a thick coat that changes from reddish brown to sparse, bristly, and nearly black as they age. Javan rhinos and Sumatran rhinos contend for the unenviable distinction of most endangered rhino species. Although Sumatran rhinos may be more numerous than Javan rhinos, they are more endangered due to habitat loss and fragmentation. Because there are few opportunities for the remaining animals to meet up and reproduce with each other, their population continues to dwindle. In the past 15 years, just two captive females have given birth.\n \nAccording to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the species is in grave risk of extinction. The famous horns of Sumatran rhinos have been their downfall. Rhino horn is said to have medicinal uses in traditional Chinese medicine, despite the fact that it is only formed of keratin, the same substance that makes up your fingernails and hair. Moreover, the horn is prized in the Middle East, particularly in Yemen, and in North Africa as a decorative dagger handle.\n \nAlthough poaching was the main factor in the decline in Sumatran rhino numbers, isolation is now their greatest concern. In the last 20 years, their population has dropped by more than 70%, and in Malaysia, they were officially declared extinct in the wild in 2019. Less than 100 Sumatran rhinos are thought to still exist in the wild, according to researchers. They have to travel further than ever to locate a spouse and have children because of their declining numbers. Even worse, if females wait too long to mate, they may develop fibroids and cysts that may render them infertile.",

Before bonobos were formally acknowledged as a distinct species in 1929, Western scientists frequently referred to them as 'pygmy chimps.'The stature of bonobos is similar to that of chimpanzees, although they have leaner bodies, smaller, more rounded shoulders, longer legs, and a tendency to walk erect. Fruits, insects, fish, and tiny animals like monkeys, hyrax, and small antelope are all part of their varied diet.\n \nThe makeup of groups frequently changes in fission-fusion societies, which are also found in chimpanzees. Smaller 'parties' will break out from the main troop to hunt elsewhere for the day. The group's senior female members typically pick when and where to go.\n \nBonobos are renowned for frequently engaging in copulation to settle disputes and sooth worried family members. They are also willing to share food with bonobos they don't know as well as their friends.\n \nYet, female bonobos are capable of violence if necessary. Three powerful females once assaulted four wayward males, chewing the alpha male's toe off, and three weeks later, he slithered back to the family.\n \nThe number of bonobos, an endangered species, in the wild is probably between 10,000 and 20,000. Worldwide, zoos, aquariums, and other facilities are home to captive bonobos.\n \nMost of the bonobo's habitat has been destroyed or fragmented as a result of war and civil upheaval in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the 1990s and 2000s, logging, and agriculture. Although though it is forbidden to hunt or kill bonobos, the apes are nonetheless poached for bushmeat, which is another reason for their decrease.\n \nHowever there are numerous initiatives underway to rescue the species. For instance, the Congolese NGO Les Amis de Bonobo du Congo returns orphaned and trafficked bonobos to their natural habitat.",

    about:
      "Great apes called chimpanzees can be found throughout central and western Africa. They are our closest living relatives, sharing 98.7% of our genetic makeup with bonobos. It is also believed that between seven and thirteen million years ago, an ancestor of both humans and chimpanzees existed.\n \nChimpanzees are very social animals. A dominant male and his coalition of male allies rule over groups of several dozen animals that make up their communities. Chimpanzees have distinct personalities, with females being more trusting and shy than males, according to research. When they clean filth and ticks from one another's bodies, chimpanzees who groom one another develop stronger social bonds.\n \nOne of the few species of intelligent animals that we are aware of using tools is this one, as noted by primatologist Jane Goodall in 1960. Archaeologist Louis Leakey said as a result of her important discovery, \"Now we must redefine 'tool,' redefine'man,' or accept chimpanzees as humans.\"\n \nChimpanzees shape and utilize sticks to dig grubs out of logs or recover insects from their nests, as Goodall noted. They utilize stones to crack open delicious nuts and use leaves as sponges to absorb liquids. Also, chimpanzees can be trained to use some simple human sign language.\n \nThe chimpanzee has been listed as an endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and the growing human population is mostly to blame. The chimpanzee's forest home is being destroyed to make room for agriculture as humans expand their geographic range. The chimp's habitat is in danger of being increasingly damaged and fragmented by activities including logging, mining, oil extraction, and new road and highway developments.\n \nConflict between humans and our closest relatives has been fuelled by habitat degradation in western Uganda. Chimpanzees struggle to find a place to live due to deforestation, which also limits their access to wild food. Several turn to foraging from adjacent human residences out of desperation. The apes occasionally kidnap and kill young children, though they often grab fruit and other food that is within reach. Chimpanzees are killed by humans as retaliation and to defend their families from further assaults.",

    name: "Franklin's Bumblebee",
    about:
      "The expanded yellow on the anterior top of the thorax, which extends behind the wing bases and forms an upside-down U-shape around the core area of black, makes Franklin's bumble bee easy to identify. The face is mostly black, the belly lacks any yellow, and the tip of the abdomen is white.\n \nThe habitat of the Franklin's bumble bee is composed of abandoned rat burrows and flowering plants like Lupinus, Eschscholzia, Agastache, Monardella, and Vicia. As social beings, bumble bees live in active colonies. By shaking the pollen free from the flower anthers with their distinctive buzzing sound, they pollinate plants. Tomatoes, blueberries, and many other well-known plants cannot be produced without this special pollination technique.\n \nFranklin's bumble bee is unique among bumble bees in the world in that it can only be found in northern California and southern Oregon between the Coast and Sierra-Cascade mountain ranges. The Franklin's bumble bee is a vulnerable species due to its rarity and endemic status, which makes the current population drop all the more concerning. Franklin's bumble bees were very common all over their range up until 1998. Subsequent surveys conducted since 2004 have nearly always failed to find even a single specimen. The US Fish and Wildlife Service has designated the species as a \"species of concern,\" which implies that no conservation measures are in place to protect it until more data is gathered.\n \nFranklin's bumble bees were designated as \"imperiled\" on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) Red List of endangered species in 2009, with a statement that the species' population has probably declined to dangerously low levels. A proper scientific examination must be conducted in order to ascertain the Franklin's bumble bee's current situation. If the species' population has actually reached a precarious level, it will need to be heavily protected in order to survive.\n \nThe health and survival of the Franklin's bumble bee are being threatened by a number of factors. Commercial bumble bee colonies used to pollinate crops have exposed native populations to a number of illnesses and genetic abnormalities. Moreover, the spread of agriculture throughout the natural range of the species has severely degraded and destroyed habitat. Bees can become poisoned by improper or excessive pesticide use, especially Franklin's bumble bee colonies that live underground. The plants that the Franklin's bumble bee depends on for food are susceptible to competition from non-native and invasive plants that have been introduced to northern California and southern Oregon.",

    name: "Whooping Crane",
    about:
      "The tallest birds in North America are these gorgeous white birds. They frequent marshes, small lakes, and lagoons and dwell in family groupings. Cranes forage for food by consuming plants, insects, fish, frogs, mussels, and other small animals with their bills.\n \nThe Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada's Northwest Territories and Alberta is the whooping crane's main natural nesting area. Here, cranes engage in complex sprinting, leaping, and wing-flapping dances to select lifelong partners.\n \nThese migratory birds leave in the late summer for the Texas Gulf Coast, where they spend the winter at the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge. A tiny introduced population resides year-round on the Kissimmee Plains in Florida. Management aim to develop a Wisconsin breeding population that will spend the winter there.\n \nHunting and egg collecting rarely harm whooping cranes, hastening their extinction. The loss of wetlands, however, continues to be their major concern. Despite being protected, the locations that the birds frequent are remote, making the entire species susceptible to any unfavorable ecological occurrence or change.\n \nWhooping cranes were so rare in the middle of the 20th century that only 16 were still alive when they were counted in 1941. Since that time, these threatened species have made some progress toward survival. Their numbers have increased thanks to captive breeding techniques, and effective reintroduction initiatives have increased the number of wild birds to several hundred.\n \nSeveral governmental departments in the United States and Canada, nonprofit groups, volunteers, and other donors are involved in the vast whooping crane management effort. Even lightweight airplanes are used to guide young whooping cranes on their first southward migration from Wisconsin to Florida as part of the procedure.",
